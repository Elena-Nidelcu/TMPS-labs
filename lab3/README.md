# Creational Design Patterns


## Author: Nidelcu Elena

## Objectives:

* Study and understand the Behavioral Design Patterns;
* As a continuation of the previous laboratory work, think about what communication between software entities might be involed in your system;
* Implement some additional functionalities using behavioral design patterns;


## Used Design Patterns:

* Observer


## Implementation

* The Observer Pattern is used in the project to implement a notification system for the furniture shop. It allows the shop (FurnitureShop class) to notify registered observers (e.g., Customer and Admin) about events like adding new furniture or applying discounts. Observers are decoupled from the shop, enabling flexibility and scalability in managing notifications. This pattern enhances user engagement by keeping customers informed about updates and helps admins monitor shop activities effectively. The integration of this pattern with the shop's facade ensures seamless management and simplifies interaction with other components of the system.

## Conclusions / Screenshots / Results
This project demonstrates the integration of various design patterns to create a robust and maintainable furniture shop management system. The use of Structural Patterns like Facade and Bridge ensures a modular and flexible structure, simplifying complex interactions and promoting scalability. The incorporation of the Observer Pattern introduces a dynamic notification mechanism, keeping users and administrators informed about important updates in real-time. By leveraging these patterns, the system achieves a balance between usability, adaptability, and efficiency, serving as a solid foundation for further enhancements and real-world applications.
